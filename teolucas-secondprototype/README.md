# Addressing feedback from TAs and peers

TA said that I "need to check whether email addresses are valid" during the first prototype. I've added email validation in this second prototype which I did not add in the first prototype. TA also mentioned that there is no obvious multi-column layout in my first prototype. So, I've added 3-columns button on top of my page and 5-columns cickable links at the bottom of the page this time. Other than that, I've kept all the features and pages in this protoype.

# API that I planning to use in final project

Firebase API by Google Analytics

# What is something you want to learn that will help?

I want to learn how to use the Firebase API and make my appliaction work. One big part of my application is to actually track the users screen activity. With the help of this API I hope that I can get those info with ease and present a comprehensive analysis to my users.

# What is something you're unsure on how to implement?

One thing that concern me alot while implementing this project is the privacy and ethics issue in my application. How do I ensure that my application can track user's screen activity without violating their privacy? Other than that, my only concern now is to making the screen tracking work because that is the core purpose of my application.
